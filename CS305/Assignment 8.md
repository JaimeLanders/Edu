## Review of Bloomberg Opinion Piece on NSA Spying
For my final weekly assignment, I chose to review an opinion piece on the shutting down of the NSA’s most controversial program, Section 214 of the patriot act which enabled the mass collection of phone records of American citizens in order to fight terrorism (“An NSA Program Fizzled Out. The World Didn’t End.,” 2019).  The Bloomberg article essentially reviews the history of the program as well as the Freedom Act of of 2015 which made it much harder for the NSA to operate the program to the point where they pretty much shut it down 6 months ago with it’s future in doubt with it’s upcoming renewal in question.

What I like about the article is that while being an opinion piece (Bloomberg Opinion), it offers a clear unbiases history on what brought this issue to the forefront of American’s minds with the reveal by Eric Snowden about the practices of the NSA that put every American’s privacy into question.  It also offers good information about the key governmental actions that have made this issue (Section 215) as well as making it less of a threat than it once was (Freedom Act).

I also appreciated the direct quotations of politicians from the slippery slope arguments of Mitch McConnell stating that the programs end was a “resounding victory of those plotting attacks against the homeland,”  as well as Marco Rubio’s quote “God forbid we wake up tomorrow and ISIL is in the United States” in response to the limitations on the program brought on by the Freedom Act.

While it would be easy to show ones bias on the issue from an editorial stand point, I felt like the article presented the issue and the current and upcoming events surrounding it as uncolored as possible with offering views from both sides of the matter without slanting any particular way.  The article even went as far as offering some of the positives about the program citing the importance of the tools needed to protect the country, which I wholeheartedly agree with even if it means I don’t particularly trust my Phone and it’s camera/microphone as a result of those tools.

Overall, for being an opinion piece the article read more like a type news article than offering any particular stance of trying to persuade readers one way or another, so I’m not exactly sure why it’s labeled an opinion piece other than offering the opinion of several people on both sides of the issue and even the NSA itself, which I appreciated.  However, I enjoyed reading the piece and feel it was a good representation of the matter without being overly persuasive or pushing any particular narrative.
