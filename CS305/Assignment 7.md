## Fighting Planned Obsolescence Through Consumerism and Legislation

For my weekly article I chose to summarize an article that my partner Miguel and I plan on covering in our upcoming presentation, the right to repair and planned obsolescence.  The article written in Salon, covers how we got to the point of allowing only companies such as Apple to repair our devices, which has put Mom and Pop repair shops for devices from electronics such as cameras to appliances out of business (Vande Pannie, 2019).  The article states that these shops most likely tech savvy enough to keep up with the changes implemented to make devices harder to upgrade, from proprietary hardware changes such as glued in battery’s and an increase in reliance of protected software on everything from smart phones to washers and dryers.

The reason for these changes is that companies such as Apple want to charge a premium for repairs to their devices which can often cost as much as a new device.  This has lead to a train of thought where if someone drops a phone a cracks the screen, they’ll often just tend up purchasing the latest model of their device instead of opting to fix the old, according to the article.  This is all a planned ploy leading to planned obsolescence which not only has a detrimental impact on consumer(ism), but on the environment as well as these practices has been a major contributor to the increase of incredibly toxic e-waste.

The article also shares some of those fighting to make the right to repair protected through state legislation such as Oregon’s own Dan Bartholomew, CEO of Portland based non-profit Free Geek.  Other’s fighting for this cause are iFixit.com’s CEO and co-founder Kyle Wiens whom also helped start Repair.org which is a resource for those interested in the cause.  He states that while there are laws protecting the repair of auto-mobiles and giving the consumer the right to repair at any willing mechanic, that there should be similar laws for tech products as well.

No states have passed any bills protected the right to repair yet, but consumers and organizations such as those listed previously are becoming savvier to these issues and are starting to realize something isn’t right when it comes to repairing their products.  The article lists several ways the consumers can make an impact in this fight such as asking oneself if they are being efficient with the products they own, asking themselves if they need appliances and things such as crock pot’s connected to the cloud, calling state representatives, and voting with their wallets.
