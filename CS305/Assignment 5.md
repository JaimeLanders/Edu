## Protecting Games from Cheats Using Copyright Law

For my weekly writing assignment, I chose to summarize an a report on Forbes from a few years ago about an issue that is very personal to me and one reason I chose to pursuit Computer Science as a degree, cheating in video games and how the creators and publishers try and protect their games from cheats.  The article summarizes how cheating in video games and the fight against it is an issue that is almost as old as video games themselves, going back to The Game Genie for the Nintendo Entertainment System (Rothberg, 2016) created by Galoob.  According to the article, Nintendo tried to stop the sale of the device by using copyright law but was ultimately unsuccessful.

This did little to stop game developers and publishers from using the Copyright Act, part of the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and copyright law to try and protect their games from malicious developers.  The article cites a much more recent and unsuccessful example of this when Blizzard Entertainment, was unable to use copyright law to shutdown Glider, a World of Warcraft (WoW) bot that automates gameplay to the advantage of the user of the bot.  Another example was when Jagaex attempted to use the DMCA and CFFA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) to shutdown Impulse Software, creator of cheats for Jagex’s Runescape, another popular MMO similar to Blizards WoW.

Ultimately the article is calling for changes to copyright law, or whole new laws all together that will protect games from cheats.  With online gaming becoming more and more popular, and some games considered as eSports generating prize pools larger than some traditional sports, there is certainly a need to protect the game developers creations and those that choose to play game legitimately.  While there has been some success in developers protecting their games and winning battles against cheat developers, the methods of doing so are outside the scope of the article I have chosen to summarize.
