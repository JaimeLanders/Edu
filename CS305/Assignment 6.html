Assignment 6 – Article Summary<br>

<h2 id="microsoft’s-topological-approach-to-quantum-computing">Microsoft’s Topological Approach to Quantum Computing</h2>
<p>For my weekly assignment I chose to summarize a Forbes article about it’s efforts to compete in Quantum Computing through a paradigm it calls the topological approach (Campbell, 2017).  There isn’t a lot known about this approach yet other than a lot of it is theoretical, thus the author calls it vaporware for the time being until more information comes out about it.  The article cites another article that mentions that Microsoft hasn’t actually built a working computer using it’s theoretical approach, thus there isn’t much to report on the Forbes article states (though it is reporting on the non-existent technology itself).</p>
<p>The article also talks about a new programming language Microsoft is calling Q# which is supposed to allow software developers to begin programming for quantum computing that don’t exactly exist yet.  Programmers are able to use Microsoft’s quantum simulator however, to test the code they write in Q#.  It is also unknow if Q# will be compatible with quantum approaches other than Microsoft’s “topological” approach, such as those its competitors have developed.</p>
<p>This also highlights the race towards becoming the dominant quantum computing approach and raises questions about Microsoft’s role in the race and the implications if it’s commitment to the topological approach backfires.  Will Microsoft be left in the dust or will they embrace a competing technology?  While it is possible to start working in Microsoft new programming language, there are also question on if it’s worth it considering the uncertainty surrounding quantum computing in general.</p>
