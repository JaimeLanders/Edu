Assignment 2 - Opinion Piece<br>
1/20/19</p>
<h2 id="assignment-2">Assignment 2</h2>
<p>For my opinion piece I chose to give my thoughts on a recent statement by Microsoft’s CTO, Kevin Scott.  Scott believes that knowledge of AI is a prerequisite to being a well informed citizen in the 21st century (Johnson, 2019).  In his opinion, people should have a proactive stance with learning about AI, instead of waiting to react once it’s already entrenched into our society.  My initial thoughts are that this is a little bit ridiculous, as I don’t feel like I would just have a conversation about AI at the dinner table, or gatherings with family, grandparents etc.  I don’t see the conversation coming up among friends either unless we were both interested in the topic or it had a direct impact on our work, for instance  That is, knowledge of AI isn’t needed in order to have a conversation about  most subjects, even those dealing with technology with the layman today.  But the more I think about it, the more I agree with his statement, the key discrepancy for me is that it is a requirement to life in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Personally I consider myself relatively “techy” and knowledgeable in computers, programming (CS major), and I still don’t know enough about the current trends in AI to feel comfortable telling my wife about it or how it works, other than the absolute basics of scripted automation and rudimentary machine learning.  One idea that I touched on briefly previously, and where I do feel that knowledge of AI is a requirement is how it will impact industries and people jobs.  One of the reason’s I chose CS as a major, other than interest in computers, is that I feel it is one of, if not the most future proof degree paths in retaining employment as the world becomes more dependent on software and especially AI.  Someone has to design, write, and maintain the software and AI that could be potentially replacing others jobs.  Even understanding how AI could replace the job you do, or at least change it from being a physical process to an automated process could give someone an advantage over those that don’t, which could add some job security or at least give you a decent forecast for the future in order to change jobs or industries.</p>
<p>Another way I believe that knowing more about AI is to alleviate fears of it, including the focus on the potential nefarious purposes for facial recognition from the government, which is in agreement with Scott’s stance on the matter.  I would also argue that the government already uses are devices to spy on us, but that doesn’t stop most from using phones with cameras and microphones enabled, laptops and TV’s with open cameras etc.  So why should we not use technology that could have many positive uses out of fear and focus on only it’s potentially negative uses?  I also feel as though I don’t have anything to hide and would be of interest for anyone will ill intentions, but I recognize that could also be a conditioning to growing up with technology and an emphasis of security over privacy.  Ignorance of AI also leads to the visualizations most have from movies like Terminator and The Matrix.  While these scenarios are connected to AI in many of our minds, the arguments against the use of AI, and at a minimum a basic knowledge of the positive uses for it mostly boil down to slippery slope.  On the other hand I feel knowledge of AI will at least give you a chance of solid ground in the future.</p>
