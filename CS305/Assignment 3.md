Assignment 3  - Critical Review of Opinion Piece

1/27/19

## Assignment 3

The opinion piece I chose to critically review is an article on The New York Times today about the safety of two-factor authentication (2FA).  The article  by Josephine Wolff asserts that the current methods of increasing security through apps, text messages or email aren't well understood enough to be relied on (Wolff, 2019).  She also an example of Google, whom many rely on app Google Authenticator for 2FA doesn't even trust the technology enough to have its own employees use the service, opting instead for physical authenticators that plug into a PC.  As an aside, the author also not-so-subtly name drops one such physical authenticator towards the beginning of the piece.  Wolff claims that hackers have shown that 2FA is no harder to phish (spoofing or imitating legit websites/apps etc.) than regular passwords, which combined with her example of Google is the main backing for her opinion on the lack of safety of 2FA.

While I may agree with Wolff that one should not put too much weight into the safety of 2FA (or any particular safety measure), I have also read from other reputable sites that 2FA maybe a replacement for the password in the future.  I would also argue that employees at a company such as google may require much stricter safety of their credentials than the typical G-Mail user, such as myself.  I am not surprised at all that even the makers of one of the main options for 2FA wouldn't trust it for their own employees whom have a lot more to lose than a typical end user, their jobs and or careers if they are compromised.  I would also argue that spoofing is always going to be a factor in security and that people should have common sense not to click on sketchy links or emails for resetting their passwords and should make sure they are using verified (SSL etc.) sites if they are promoted to change their password.  This to me should be common sense for all but the most premature of the tech/internet revolution.

While I'm not ready to give up passwords for 2FA, especially ones generated uniquely and randomly by a password manager, I feel that 2FA is an important additional security measure to supplement passwords, even if it is annoying at times.  I don't feel that I would personally fall victim to a phishing attempt even though I likely get at least one such attempt in my email boxes daily, and I don't believe that most whom are worried enough about their security to use 2FA would either, as it generally is at least a little bit of a hassle to setup and certainly adds extra time and effort to get into your 2FA enabled accounts.  Overall I feel the piece was fair in that 2FA shouldn't be an end-all be-all for security, but also can see a thinly veiled attempt to promote physical keys such as the one name-dropped in the article as well as passively promoted by lending credibility for Google's reliance on the technology (although not necessarily the one named) and lack of faith in their own.
