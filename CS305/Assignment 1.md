## Assignment 1  
For my article summary I chose to summarize an article I found on Google News published by Fortune, which I feel is a credible source of information regarding ethics in not only business, but in the software industry as well.  The article outlines how an employee working at Kaspersky Lab, makers of the Kaspersky anti-virus suite ousted a contractor for the NSA that stole what could be the largest theft of classified government information in history (Reints, 2019).  The contractor, Harold Thomas Martin III was arrested in 2016 and indicted in 2017 after FBI agents found proof of classified information at his home in Maryland.  Martin had apparently been trying to sell the information to Kaspersky using an alias and attempting to contact Kaspersky Lab's CEO Eugene Kaspersky through Twitter messages to researchers.   

Kaspersky previously worked with the U.S. government by helping find hackers, but was labeled as a security threat by U.S. security officials in 2012 after connections to Russian Intelligence agencies were exposed to the U.S. by Israeli hackers.  Unfortunately, the move may have done little to earn back trust from the U.S. government, even though Kaspersky has also tried to separate itself from it's Russian intelligence image in recently.  The interesting part of this article is that an organization that previously worked with the U.S. was then labeled a security threat, but then exposed a security threat within the U.S.' own governmental agency, the NSA.  Perhaps the NSA, and U.S. Intelligence agencies aren't doing such a good job of protecting data on the government and the people they represent after all.
